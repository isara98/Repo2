##  Objectives

*   Master basic Unix surival skills:
    -   Configure your environment (`export`, `echo`, dotfiles)
    -   Understand Unix permissions
    -   Navigate filesystem (`cd`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `find`, `chmod`, `chown`)
    -   Examine and characterize files (`less`, `head`, `tail`, `cat`, `wc`, `od`, `grep`, `md5sum`)
    -   Operate on text files (`sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, `paste`, `sed`, `awk`)
    -   Use filter + pipes model to create complex commands
    -   Write a basic shell script
    -   Access a remote machine (`ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`)
    -   Survive `vi`, `emacs`, `nano`, or `pico`

##  A little background on today's topics

Unix -- and by extension OS/X from the terminal -- provides the best platform for doing science because it is robust and has many simple simple commands which can easily be combined to solve whatever problems you encounter.  Furthermore, scientific clusters and cloud computing such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) almost always runs some flavor of Linux.  Learning Unix will considerably boost your productivity because it will help you wrangle data and quickly answer questions about files, data, and more.

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (a.k.a.,  REGEX or RE) are a language to describe arbitrarily complex patterns.  Learning regex will improve your abilities to search and replace text in your code and other files.  [RegExr](http://www.regexr.com) is a great resource to learn, test, and develop regular expressions.  You can use REGEX with both Unix command-line tools such as `grep`, editors, and  programming languages, including Python, Perl, and others.

##  References

For Unix, one of Sobell's Linux books is a great references, such as [A Practical Guide to Linux Commands, Editors, and Shell Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Commands-Editors-Programming-ebook/dp/B009AVGJLO/ref=la_B000APJW04_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1444934667&sr=1-4&refinements=p_82%3AB000APJW04) because it covers all the basics as well as shell programming and editors

[Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com) is a fun game which will teach you how to use `vim`.

A nice [tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htm) on regular expressions is available on [tutorialpoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htm).  Use [RegExr](http://www.regexr.com) to test your REs.
